# Simple game "Eight Queens" on Java and Swing

### In chess, a queen can capture any piece in the same row, column or diagonal as it. It is necessary to place 8 queens on the chessboard so that none of them captures another.

### Each queen will be tasked with finding an acceptablesolution for itself (and its neighbors to the left). The solution to the entire problem will be obtained when the rightmost queen finds an acceptable solution
